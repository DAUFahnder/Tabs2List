# Tabs2List
Firefox Webextension

You can use this extension to display your tabs as a list in the sidebar and/or in a popup. A second view lists the recently closed tabs. In addition to various standard functions, tabs in the tab bar can be hidden manually or automatically. This helps to reduce the resources used by the browser and provides a better overview in the tab bar. Hidden tabs are still visible and quickly accessible in the list.
